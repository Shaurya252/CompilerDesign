# 🛠️ MyCompiler – A Simple Compiler Project in Python

This project is a simple compiler built using Python and PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). It performs lexical analysis (tokenization), syntax analysis (parsing), and basic error handling for a simple custom language.

🚀 How to Run the Project
✅ Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

ply library

🔧 Install Dependencies
Open terminal (or Git Bash) and run:
pip install ply

▶️ Run the Compiler
